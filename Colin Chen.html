			Welcome! I am a Information Master student at the University of Michigan. I earned my Bachelor's degree
			in psychology at the University of Washington. I worked in depth with Dr. Marsha Linehan at the Behavioral Research and Therapy Clinics researching about Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I have been classically trained as a pianist since I was 6 and never stopped playing since then. Also I recently started playing the violin. When I'm free, I like to play chamber music with friends. My favorite composers are Beethoven and J.S.Bach.
